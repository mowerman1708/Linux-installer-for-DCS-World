This is a project I did to install DCS World on GNU/Linux systems without the need for Lutris or Steam.
The script will download the current wine version and DCS World install program. Then it will create a wine 
prefix for the game with the name of choice if you would like or just create an empty directory and select
that.
The program has an animated label to show when it is working. It does take a few minutes for the downloads
and the prefix creation.
Lastly we start the DCS World install program. If you have ever installed DCS World then you know it takes
a long time to download. The site seems to be capped at 11 mbs?? But anyway 8hrs download in my testing.
The installation will create desktop icons for your use, I haven't actually had the program run yet but think
it may have been in the prefix creation. It does launch the updater but crashes hard before getting a login
prompt. 
I have another installer for Star Trek Fleet Command that works well, this is a work in progress! Use at your 
own risk. Only problems I ru into is closing the program, that normally results in killing the process. Thinking
that may be a wine thing? STFC won't shotdown from Lutri either. I Don't generally use Steam put having a nice
working copy of Falcon BMS on Linux also. Maybe another project some day?
